LatexResumeTemplate
===================

*Michael Elliot King's LaTeX Resume Template, based off of the Academic CV template by Dario Taraborelli*

I have created a template from my curriculum vit√¶ with lots of helpful tips and notes so any user can open it and understand the content. Download or clone the files to your computer and get started! 

### Instructions ###

1. Open the MKsResumeTemplate.tex file in your favorite LaTeX editor
2. Install Linux Libertine font
3. Change your compiler to use XeLaTex if needed (pdfTex is the default compiler)
4. Begin replacing the content with your own
5. Pay attention to all comments; they explain the code and give helpful tips
6. Compile when complete!
